Part 2 Exp2

a) 	To configure a bridge, we need to create the bridge by using the command: "/interface bridge add name=bridgeY0"
	Then, we need to remove the ports where the aimed resources are connected (default bridge) by using:
	"/interface bridge port remove [find interface =etherX]"
	Finally we add the now free resource to the corresponding port to bridgeY0 by using:
	"/interface bridge port add bridge=bridgeY0 interface=etherX"

b) 	There are 2 broadcast domains, 1 for tuxY3 and tuxY4 and another one for tuxY2, since their networks can't reach one
	another. We can conclude this from the logs, since the tuxY2 does not respond to the tuxY3 broadcast ping, and both
	tuxY3 and tuxY4 don't answer to the tuxY2 broadcast ping.

c) 	The observed ARP messages and associated MAC addresses are:
				      "Who has 172.16.40.1? Tell 172.16.40.254" -> "172.16.40.1 is at 00:21:5a:61:2f:13"
				      "Who has 172.16.40.254? Tell 172.16.40.1" -> "172.16.40.254 is at 00:21:5a:c3:78:76"
				      "Who has 172.16.41.1? Tell 172.16.41.253" -> "172.16.41.1 is at 00:22:64:19:02:ba"
				      "Who has 172.16.41.253? Tell 172.16.41.1" -> "172.16.41.253 is at 00:c0:df:02:55:95"
	They are observed, because tuxY4, where the bridges Y0 and Y1 are connected, needs to know the which bridge has the
	following address, in order to correctly redirect the message.

d)	The ICMP packets observed are the (ping) request and (ping) reply from the tuxY3 (172.16.40.1) to tuxY2 (172.16.41.1)
	and vice-versa. They are observed, because using the tuxY4 to connect both bridges, there is a valid connection between
	tuxY3 and tuxY4 (since the connection exists, the request (ping) gets a reply (ping) back).

e)	The IP addresses are the corresponding addresses from the tuxY3 and tuxY4 | 172.16.40.1 and 172.16.41.1
	The MAC addresses are ?? // TO DO

Part 2 Exp4

a)	In order to configure a static route in a commercial router, we need to use the command
	"/ip route add dst-address=X gateway=X" outside the terminal (not sure of the application name)

c) // TO DO

d) 	NAT is responsible for mapping an IP address space into another address. It's a way to map multiple local private addresses to a public one
	before transferring the information. Organizations that want multiple devices to use a single IP Address use NAT.
